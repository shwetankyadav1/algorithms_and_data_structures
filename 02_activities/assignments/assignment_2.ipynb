    "I went through the examples to determine input format correspondence to shown binary trees;  it was traversing them in BFS. Next step was to figure out how to recognize tree from input string, focusing on fact that it is binary & every depth level has 2^(depth) nodes. So, defined function with loop to first print out each depth level’s nodes to check if it was recognizing levels correctly. Realizing could look at each level’s node’s independently, decided to iterate through them while checking visited nodes for duplicates. To figure out closest to root, had to store each visited node’s distance, so put them in a dictionary with depth level (corresponding to distance to root). So now, also check shortest distance to choose duplicate. Checked with examples, including empty and 1 element trees. For alternate solution, realized didn’t need to separate out levels, just being earlier in input list meant closer or equal in distance to root than current node, needing only one ‘for’ loop and simpler code. \n",
